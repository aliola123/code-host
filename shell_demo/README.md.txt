#Moses Alipoe here, alx holberton school student 
This is a shell demo with no implementation except that 
of exit which works but with errors.

#The use of /bin before a command name works perfectly fine
for most commands, including ones with arguments 
E.g 
/bin/ls works
/bin/mkdir alx creates a directory named alx
/bin/rm -r does recursive deletion for any file indicated

#You coould specify the environment variable to run command without
reliance on the bin path specification

HAPPY CODING
